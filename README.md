# updated-portfolio

For the bootcamp, we were tasked with creating and periodically updating a professional portfolio so we could practice design, and then use it in the future for job hunting.

The objective was to display a headshot alongside a short about me section, a gallery of my completed coding projects, and a contact section with ways to get in touch with me and links to other social media platforms.

The completed projects have links to the deployed application, as well as the GitHub repos they live in, so users can view them and access the READMEs for each individual project.

Designed with mobile first in mind, this portfolio should scale and adjust itself no matter the screen size or device the user is viewing it with.
